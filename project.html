<strong> PROJECT-1: Use of Artificial Intelligence in Health Care </strong>
<p>Personalized medicine is one of the problems for the doctors because some of the drugs work effectively in diagnosing patients whereas it causes side effects on others. Alongside this lifestyle, age and several other genetic factors of people vary from one another which show that each of the patients needs diagnosis and treatment as per their genetic factors. This problem can be resolved with the implementation of artificial intelligence algorithm.</p>

<strong>PROJECT-2: Automated Teaching Assistant Job Application System </strong>
<p>The current method that students are using to apply for teaching assistant position in my university involves lot of paper work that to be done by students, faculty and also the chair. To provide flexibility in the process, this project implements an automated system by using Kanban software process model. This project makes the chair job easier instead of evaluating the students profile and also to maintain the student’s data. Kanban method was used to implement this system as this model maintains efficiency and transparency throughout the implementation cycle. </p>
